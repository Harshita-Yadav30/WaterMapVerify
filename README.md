# WaterMapVerify

It is a Django-based website for classifying water images and videos into Clean Water, Dirty Water, and Irrelevant (e.g. selfies etc.). The application allows users to upload images or videos of any location with contaminated water along with the name of place, geolocation coordinates and description, if any. This project will aid in aggregating a database of polluted water locations and will greatly help the government bodies and NGOs in identifying dirty water places for cleaning.

The web app will help in reducing the overall time taken for cleanliness of polluted water as a lot of time goes in searching for such places, however our designed application will give data of these places instantly. By designing this project, we hope to contribute in more clean water reservoirs and a better living environment for all.
